see two buttons below my video of what would you like to do Blyx Studio Demo today create an image or creating a video obviously they can upgrade their plans raw links in here so anyone who wants to upgrade will be able to now we also have on the left hand side the actual um menu items that we have as well which is Vision Edge which is an upgrade their Creations the template club that we have which is going to be updated each and every single month they can create a new image new video and then their upgrades here but the main two is obviously create new image or new video I'm going to go image first now as you can see you can have New Image where you can upload one select from media library upload their own template that they've saved to their computer the template library is within this area they can save their favorites or create their own as well they can also start with a blank canvas customized blog Facebook Facebook ad and so on and so forth I'm just going to click that just to show you the sizes an AI image as well where they can tie in their own API keys we're not charging the Earth for this we're allowing people to actually get excuse me an IM Jing tinal with AI possibilities as well we give them credits each and every month but we also allow them to add in their own apis the upsell is unlimited so they actually have our apis that they use and so we don't go broke giving everyone free access just hoping for the 8020 rule where only 20% of people will use it um we're being smart about this so they can add in stability <strong>Blyx Studio OTO </strong>AI open AI clip drop or even sketch to image which is basically you draw whatever you like I know I'm an artist you don't have to tell me but what it is is you're write in the prompt tell it what you want it to do and just hit generate with clip drop it's just a simple prompt and then generate open AI prompt choose the source so they can choose an image size and a style Vivid or natural and then stability AI which is my favorite personally The Prompt they can do negative prompt which we all know what that is now basically it's what you don't want in the image the source which is the aspect ratio that they can choose and the seed which they can copy so when they edit it in the future if it asks for the seed or you can use the seed then it will remember obviously whi<strong>Blyx Studio OTO </strong>ch image it created and then the style which is auto 3D model analog and so on and so forth now there's various different things that you can do with this but with a prompt like this I'm going to show you man and woman walking on a beach typo I'm going to choose in fact the style I'm going to choose um photographic hit generate as you can see man and woman walking on the beach you can save your seed so you can copy it put it onto a notepad you can download it if you just want the image or you can select it into the image editing tool this is where it gets fun fa<strong>Blyx Studio OTO </strong>ntastic and fast my friends so you can crop the image you can use free form custom Square original ratio so if I go free form oh drag it bada bing bada boom I can then cut everything else out and it would just crop down to that size but then on the other hand we can uncrop it using out paint which we can then extend this image which I will get to you can rotate it you can rotate it right left which I kind of like if you have any image that's already upside down or anything you can flip it X so I like this as well so you can position it on the other side and then you can upside down it as well you can resize it to your liking you can regenerate it so basically like I said with the seed if you remember here you can paste it into it knows obviously the prompt of what you want it to be and what you don't want it to be and the alpha mask basically as it says here if Alpha mask is enabled fully transparent pixels are replaced and fully opaque pixels are unchanged you can use your rase background image brush to remove the pixels on the background image so basically you can use the brush to remove different parts that you want changed you can remove the background with the click of a button there you go now then you can obviously as you can see around because of a hair it makes it a bit difficult but then what you can do is you can go to background start drawing drop this down to say like 10 um and then you can remove this just these bits around here and then away you go just by going in fact I'm going to stop drawing I'm going to cancel that as well because I'm mindful of everyone's time stop drawing but then I'll show you in the next feature anyway or one of the next features you can upscale it to buy forx you can erase things which is with the brush so if I had have got this fluffy bit of hair here it's a windy day she's on a beach um you can remove it with the brush like I just did and then click erase you can out paint which you can extend the image top and bottom I want to keep this the same imagine if there's a couple and they want a landscape image it was too short someone took it and it was just them and none of the image then you can do stuff like this very cool features by the way when you think about how it actually works to understand what the image is what is in the foreground and what's in the background and how to EXP band on it it's really incredible the results that you get as well I've done some when I did um some fitness shoot for one of my friends and it actually put me in a whole gym there was just a picture of me and it looked like I was actually in the gym it looked real very very realistic it was incredible now bear with it because it does take some time I say this in the tutorials as well like obviously it needs to figure out what it's doing to expand on it but as you can see the consistency is very very nice it's not something that stands out a mile and then you can generate again if you want and you can go even bigger you can replace or you could replace the man with a dog if you really wanted to and hit generate you can recolor something so you wanted to change that jacket you could basica<strong>Blyx Studio OTO </strong>lly say change the the guy's jacket to a green jacket and then you could say blue jacket on the mail and then it would find it from the select prompt here so like it says short descript of what to search for but being detailed you get the best results as well image edit so you can actually change the image with by painting onto the erase background image and then telling it what you want as well image variation you hit a button you can remove the background easy peasy stuff you can replace the background easy peasy stuff literally click of a button you can clean it up as well you just Mark The Unwanted objects with a pencil brush you can remove text so if there was a shop sign in the background or anything like that just press a button and away it goes uncrop is the same as out paint here but it's different apis if you've noticed as well there's other filters we call them quick filters so there's grayscale so you want to make it grayscale or sepia different ones you can sharpen the image as you can see if you're looking at the video of the people now you can sharpen it you can emboss it you can do all kinds of stuff it's really cool stuff this is you can do the basic adjustments the brightness contrast saturation and the Hue change the gamma blend color Duo tone effect swap colors and even Advanced edits as well so you could actually pixelate the image should you wish to um not that you actually would if he was working on something that is just one element that we then have frames here so you can add your favorites from any of these we have cute ones Halloween love water color obviously they stack over on the right hand side we have layers so we have frame one two and three that we've added so I don't want the hearts anymore<strong>Blyx Studio OTO </strong> let's get rid of that I don't want this one either get rid of that and then I want to put text in so I click Text add text um this is an [Music] example oh click the wrong one I move this here I then can Center it um Sunset Beach Walk uh a April 2024 I don't know if you want to keep a memory and then you have that you can Lefty it middle it right here or you can even break it up if you like so it's spread across evenly I want it on the middle um change the the font family you can also search so if we did aerial then it changes the text impact um line height so say for example you wanted on two lines you hit the line high as you can see spacing it out as I do it on the text I'm clicking it now if you want to check it out we have letter spacing as well um fill style so that's the background basically outline and so on and so forth you can add more images if you like you can also add in different shapes so for example you could add that into here I'm not saying you'd want to and then you can fill the color get a pinky color put in whatever text you like with this text as well you can move it you can do everything um like this if I want to put something in t<strong>Blyx Studio OTO </strong>he middle you'll see the guidelines so that shows that it's exactly in the middle as I scroll down as you'll see now there's an X like crosshairs on a gun um on a scope this is just some of the elements there's the shapes if I want this behind here for example all I have to do is drag it and it gives precedence from the top down layers as you can see um if I want to delete lock copy Etc hide it for now and I can do that I can add in different elements so if I want ink brush Strokes for example I can do ones like this this I can change it yellow whatever I want the X on the bottom here is obviously delete and then you can copy it so you can duplicate things like I say it really really is simple to use these features we also have icons so if you really wanted to add in icons we have app so we have barcode triangle art QR code as well Brands country flags cryptocurrency and even multi- Avatar so if I wanted to do a random one I can choose whatever I want if I wanted to remember it for future use I can just copy this code I've copied it already so if I select this paste it back in it goes back to the one that I copied and then brush is where you start drawing and this is where you can do different things you can obviously normally use it but if you want to remove things sometimes you need the pencil brush which brush with AI features or the erase background image um which is basically this kind of stuff really really simple to use and really really fun as well that's the good thing people know how to use this I passed this to some of my customers to test it out and they all love it they actually preferred it to cber and I not even joking they said this on a webinar um that's just one element though because we also have back on the dashboard and<strong>Blyx Studio OTO </strong> you can save it obviously you can create your video so here you have settings templates uploads text objects so you can add objects in in your images from pexels and pixabay videos as well from pixels and pixer Bay you can add your audio if you like you can browse for more QR code you can add in as well if you if you want to make a gif image or a video that you put on to TV for like a t TV adver or YouTube TV ads because in YouTube videos obviously over 100 million people watch TV now um we have the normal settings with the presets that you can choose and the template so a template this is um what you can do with this side of things if I go to the canas setting I can increase the duration to make it longer I only make short videos right now but it's going to improve over time we're very transparent about that um you can change the width and the height and different things different layers inside here as you'll see there's training being made right now but if you just drop down you see the Pres the position and the angle and such that you can actually change so if I just press play you'll see how these templates work and then you can down load it as a web M video recommended an animated gif which is obviously slower and an image which is no animation you can change everything on these templates as well so people have a a starting point I guess before they start doing different things um beginning their own Journey with creating things but you can see even where you remove it there or move it there sorry it works you can add the audio and such as well like I mentioned it really is simple to use and I've done it so it's affordable for people to use as well first up we have the front end Blyx
